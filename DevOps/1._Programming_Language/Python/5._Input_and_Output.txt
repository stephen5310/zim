===== Fancier Output Formatting =====

* Formatted string litterals : f'Results of the {literal} {event}' or F'Results of the {year} {event}'
* The str.format to use { and } to mark where a variable will be substituted and provide detailed formatting directives : '{:-9} YES votes  {:2.2%}'.format(yes_votes, percentage)
* The str() function is meant to return representations of values which are fairly human-readable
* The repr() is meant to generate representations which can be read by the interpreter but are not interpreted in output (i.e. \n will not go to next line)
*
