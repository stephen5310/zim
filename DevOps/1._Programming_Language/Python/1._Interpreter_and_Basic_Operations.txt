====== 1. Interpreter and Basic Operations ======
Created lundi 07 novembre 2022

====== Using the interpreter ======

Using the CLI :
* Invoke : python or py or python3 or python2
* Exit : quit() or exit() or ctrl+d
* Line-editing features supported on systems with GNU Readline library
* Test line-editing : ctrl+p
* Inline usage : python -c "command [arg]" // python -c "print('hello')"
* Inline usage of module : python -m module [arg] // python -m "base64" -t 'Aladdin:open sesame'
* Enter interactive mode after script execution : python -i script [arg] // python -i /usr/lib/python3.10/base64.py -t 'Aladdin:open sesame'

===== Argument passing =====

* The script name and additional arguments will be in a list of strings named **argv** in the sys module
* Access the list of arguments : import sys and sys.argv
* Script name can be given as '-' meaning standard input
* When -c command is used sys.argv[0] is set to '-c'
* When -m command is used sys.argv[0] is set to the full name of the located module
* Options found after -c or -m are not consumed by the interpreter but left in sys.argv for the command or module to handle

===== Source Code Encoding =====

* UTF-8 is used by default
* To declare an encoding a special comment line is added as the **first line** of the file as follows : # -*- coding: encoding -*-
	* encoding is one of the valid codecs supported by Python
* On UNIX the shebang line should be the first line and the encoding should come second

===== Basic calculus =====

* Addition (+), subtraction (-), classic division (/), multiplication (*)
* Floor division (//), modulo (%), exponent (**)

===== Variables =====

* Assignment with (=) : var = value
* Spaces are not taken into account unless in quotes
* Double quotes (") precede single (') ones
* Three double (""") or (''') single quotes for a multiple lines string 
* Escape (\), new line (\n)
* Ignore special characters in string output with (r) called raw string : print(r'string \n string')
* Strings can be multiplied and summed but not divided nor subtracted
* Strings are indexed but does not support item assignment, they are immutable
* Lists slices are new lists, for a shallow copy use : list[:]
* Lists support concatenation, item assignment, slice assignment
* Modifications to shallow copy are made to original
* Lists can be nested
