====== 5. Pointers ======
Created samedi 17 f√©vrier 2024

* Variable that holds the memory address of another one
* Point where this memory is allocated

===== Address-of Operator =====

* Use **''&''** to get the address where a variable is stored : ''pointer = &var''

===== De-reference Operator =====

* Use **''*''** to manipulate the value at the address stored by the pointer : ''value = *pointer''
* Modify the value : ''*pointer = new_value''

===== Declaration and initialization =====

* Declare : ''var <pointer_name> *<data_type>''
* Initializing : 
	* Specifying data type : ''var <pointer_name> *<data_type> = &<variable_name>''
	* Not specifying data type : ''var <pointer_name> = &<variable_name>''
	* Shorthand : ''<pointer_name> := &<variable_name>''

===== Passing arguments by reference to a function =====

* By default arguments are passed by value
	* Only a copy is accessed
* Passing by reference means passing a pointer to the variable in argument
	* The data of the orginal variable is directly manipulated by the function
	* The parameter type in the function definition must be a pointer
''func modify(s'' **''*string''**'') {''
 ''*s = "world"''
''}''
''modify(''**''&a''**'')''
* **Slices and maps are passed by reference by default**
