====== 4. API Development ======
Created vendredi 23 f√©vrier 2024

===== API Server =====

* Use **''http''** library

==== ListenAndServer(addr string, handler Handler) error ====
* Creates a server
* Listens on the TCP network address addr
* Calls Serve with handler to handle requests on incoming connections
* Accepted connections are configured to enable TCP keep-alives
* The handler is typically nil, in which the DefaultServeMux is used
* Always return a non-nil error

==== REST architecture ====
* REpresentational State Transfer
* Client requests transfer a representation of the state of the resource to the requester/endpoint
* Data is delivered via HTTP in json, yaml, xml, html, xlt, python, php or plain text
* An API is RESTful if :
	* It manages servers and resources through http with a client-server architecture
	* Client-server communication is stateless : 
		* No client info is stored between GET requests
		* Each request is separate and unconnected
	* Uniform interface between components so that information is transferred in a standard form
	* Allows Code-on-demand (optional) : 
		* Send executable code from server to client when requested
		* Extends client functionality

==== Project explanation ====
* Develop a REST API to manage products
* Product attributes : Id, name, quantity, price
* Products will be stored in a database
* Five API endpoints :
	* GET [[/products]] to get the list of all the products
	* GET [[/product/id]] to get info about a product
	* POST [[/product]] to create a new product in the db
	* PUT [[/product/id]] to update a product
	* DELETE [[/product/id]] to delete a product

==== Mux Router ====
* Package gorilla/mux 
* Like standard http.ServeMux : 
	* **''mux.Router''** matches incoming requests against a list of registered routes and calls a handler for the corresponding route or other conditions
* Supports : 
	* Method based routing
	* Variables in url paths
	* Regex route patterns

==== MySQL Driver ====
* Used interact with a mysql database
