====== 1. Basics ======
Created samedi 17 f√©vrier 2024

* Created by engineers at Google to combine :
	* The ease of programming of an interpreted, dynamically typed language (python)
	* The efficiency and safety of a statically typed, compiled language (Java, C++)
	* The aim to be modern, with support for networked multicore computing
* Go is compiled

===== First Program : simple Hello World =====

''package main''

''import "fmt"''

// This is a comment

''func main() {''
	''fmt.Print("Hello World!")''
''}''

==== Packaging ====
* Way of organizing and reusing code
* Every go program must start with the package declaration
* When building reusable pieces of code, packages are developed as shared libraries
* For executable programs, the package **''main''** is enough

==== Import ====
* Used to import packages
* **''fmt''** is short for format. It implements formatting for input and output.
* In go package names in import are surrounded by double quotes

==== Comments ====
* Comment on one line start with //
* Comment multiple lines start with [[/*]] and end with */

==== Functions ====
* Declaration start with **''func''** keyword
* The **''main''** function in go contain the code that is executed
* Every executable program must contain the single main package and the main function
