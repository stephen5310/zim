====== 7. Lambda ======
Created mardi 07 janvier 2025

* Easy to get more resources per functions (up to 10GB Ram)
* Increasing Ram also increases CPU and network
* Pay per calls/duration

===== S3 Event Notifications =====
* Enable bucket versioning to make sure a notification will be sent for each event

===== X-Ray Tracing =====
* Runs the X-Ray daemon
* Use the X-Ray SDK in Code
* Ensure Lambda has rights to write in X-Ray
* Env vars to communicate with X-Ray:
	* _X_AMZN_TRACE_ID: tracing header
	* AWS_XRAY_CONTEXT_MISSING: by default, LOG_ERROR
	* AWS_XRAY_DAEMON_ADDRESS: X-Ray daemon IP_ADDRESS:PORT

===== CONFIG =====
* Timeout range from 3s(default) to 15mn(maximum)
* Can reuse execution context between lambda invocations
	* Includes the /tmp (max 10GB)
	* Initialize variables that will be reused outside of the handler to leverage that
* Configure throttling with **reserved concurrency** at the function level (1000 max)
* Use **provisioned concurrency** to avoid cold starts
	* Can be managed by App auto-scaling
