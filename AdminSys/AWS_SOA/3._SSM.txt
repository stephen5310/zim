====== 3. SSM ======
Created mardi 07 janvier 2025

* Free service to manage EC2 and On-premises systems at scale
* Get operational insights about performance
* Easily detect problems
* Patching automation for enhanced compliance
* Supports Linux and Windows
* Integrated with CW Metrics and Dashboards, AWS Config
* The SSM Agent must be installed on the instance

==== SSM Agent installation and registration ====

==== Fleet Manager ====
* Register instances to manage them
* Start instances with SSM Agent installed and an IAM Role with **AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore** policy attached to register automatically
* No need for SG

==== Tags and Resource grouping ====
* Tags are used for:
	* Resource grouping
	* Automation
	* Cost allocation
* Use AWS Resource Groups service to create a resource group using
	* Tags
	* CloudFormation stack

==== SSM Documents ====
* json or yaml docs with parameters and actions on fleets/groups
* Used to :
	* Just run a command 
	* Use State Manager
	* Use Patch Manager
	* Automate stuff
	* Retrieve data from parameter store

==== SSM Run Commands ====
* Use docs to execute script or command
* Rate control / Error control
* Integrated with IAM & Cloudtrail
* See output in console, send to S3 or CW Logs
* Send notifications to SNS about statuses
* Invoke with EventBridge

==== SSM Automation ====
* Simplifies common maintenance and deployment tasks of AWS resources
	* Restart instances
	* Create AMI, EBS snapshots
* The SSM Document is called **Automation Runbook**
* Triggered :
	* Manually using console, cli or sdk
	* EventBridge / AWS Config for rules remediation
	* On a schedule using Maintenance Windows

==== SSM Parameter Store ====
* Secure hierarchal storage for configuration and secrets, optional encryption with KMS
* Serverless, scalable, durable, easy to use, versioned
* Security with IAM, notifs with EventBridge
* Integrated with CloudFormation
* Can retrieve Secrets Manager secrets with : **/aws/reference/secretsmanager/[secret_id_in_secrets_manager]**
* Can retrieve public parameters like the latest amazon linux AMI ID
* Two tiers:
	* Standard (free):
		* 10,000 params / account / region
		* Max 4KB
		* No params policies
	* Advanced ($0.05 per param per month):
		* 100,000 params / account / region
		* Max 8KB
		* Params policies available
* Parameter policies:
	* TTL for expiration to force updating or deletion
	* Can send notifications to EventBridge

==== SSM Inventory ====
* Collect metadata from managed instances (softwares, drivers, confs, updates, running services...)
	* Disabled by default, Must be enabled
* View in console, store in S3 (Resource Data Sync), query and analyze using Athena and QuickSight
* Specify collection interval
* Query data from multiple accounts and regions
* Create Custom Inventory for custom metadata (rack location)

==== State Manager ====
* Automate the process of keeping instances in defined state
* Define a state and specify a schedule to apply the configuration
* Use SSM Documents to create an association

==== Patch Manager ====
* Automate the process of patching instances (updates)
* Supports Linux, Windows ans MacOS
* Patch on-demand or on a schedule using Maintenance Windows
* Scan instances and generate a patch compliance report
* **Patch Baseline**:
	* Defines patches that should / shouldn't be installed on instances
	* Patches can be auto-approved within days of release
	* By default only critical patches and patches related to security are installed
* **Patch Group**:
	* Associate a set of instances with a specific patch baseline
	* Instances should be defined with the **tag key Patch Group**
	* An instance can only be in one patch group, and a patch group can be registered with only one patch baseline

==== Maintenance Window ====
* Defines a schedule to perform actions on instances
* Contains Schedule, Duration, Set of registered instances, Set of registered tasks

==== Session Manager ====
* SSH on instances through console, cli, or Session Manager SDK
* No SSH access / keys / bastion, just IAM permissions and SSM Agent
* Logs of connections and commands history, can be sent to s3 or CW Logs
* Use CloudTrail to intercept a StartSession event
	* Can restrict commands that can be run in a session and stop it
