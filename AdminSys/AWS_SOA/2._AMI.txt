====== 2. AMI ======
Created mardi 07 janvier 2025

* Region bound, can be copied to another
* AWS Marketplace AMI to download or buy
* Make our own with tools like Packer, EC2 Image Builder, or using the Console
* Can be created with the No-Reboot option to avoid reboot:
	* Risk of loss for fs integrity
	* OS Buffers not flushed to disk
* Can use snapshots with AWS Backup to create:
	* fs integrity not guaranteed because the No-Reboot option is enabled by default
	* Can provide the reboot parameter while taking images (EventBridge + Lambda + CreateImage API with reboot)
* Use to migrate EC2 instances between AZ/Region

==== Cross-account ====
* Can share with another account only AMIs with non-encrypted or customer encrypted volumes
* Can be shared publicly
* Can copy an AMI to another account to create a new one

==== EC2 Image Builder ====
* Automate creation, maintain, validate and test AMIs and container images
	* SSM Agent must be installed on the image
* Regional service that can distribute the built images to multiple regions
* Free, schedulable

==== In Prod ====
* Can force users to launch instances for only approved AMIs (tagged) using IAM policies
* Combine with AWS Config to find non-compliant instances
