====== 8. EBS & EFS ======
Created mardi 07 janvier 2025

===== EBS =====

* Volumes are locked to AZ, use snapshots to move
* Can multi-attach 16 max instances on the same volume
* Cannot decrease size:
	* Commands to repartition when increasing can be different
* Can use Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager to automate snapshots creation, retention and deletion
	* Can't be used to maanage snapshots created outside of it, or instance-store backed instances

===== EFS =====

* Can use Access Points to manage access with POSIX permissions or IAM policies
	* Good for chrooting
* Operations that require migration using datasync:
	* Migration to encrypted EFS
	* Performance mode
