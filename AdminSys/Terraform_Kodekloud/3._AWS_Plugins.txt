===== Access AWS account =====

* Log into the account with aws cli

* When using aws sso you just have to set the **''AWS_PROFILE''** env var to the sso profile you used to log in
* Go to https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs for more authentication methods
* Go to the same link for resource creation
