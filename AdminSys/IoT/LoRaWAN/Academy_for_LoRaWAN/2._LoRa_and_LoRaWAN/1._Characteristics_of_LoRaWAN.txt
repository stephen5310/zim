====== 1. Characteristics of LoRaWAN ======
Created mercredi 01 mars 2023

===== Characteristics =====

* LoRa is at the physical layer while LoRaWAN is at Data Link, Network and Session layers
	* Long range (2-3 km (1-2miles) urban, >5 km (3 miles) suburban, >50 km (30 miles) with visual line-of-sight)
	* Long battery life (>1 years)
	* Low data rate (0.3 â€“ 50 kbps) :
		* LoRa Modulation : 0.3 - 11 kbps
		* FSK Modulation : 50 kbps
		* High DR cause small SF and high probability of packet loss
		* Low DR cause high SF, longer Time on Air, Higher power consumption, longer range, reduces GW capacity
	* Operates in the unlicensed spectrum
	* Geolocation support
* It is a software standard that specifies the data packet format and the way they are processed by the network and the end devices
* LoRaWAN network high level components are :

* LoRaWAN specifies the mechanisms that are carried out by these components :
	* Configuring the radio parameters such as data rates, enable channels, timing, settings, device activation, message integrity checking, session management, app payload encryption
* Frequencies are below 1GHz of the ISM band :
	* Europe :
		* EU 868 (863 - 870)
		* 8 channels up to 5.5 kbps
		* 1 channel up to 11 kbps
		* 1 channel up to 50 kbps with FSK modulation
		* 3 fixed channels that must be supported by all devices and networks to allow any device to join any network
		* Duty Cycle Limitations :
			* Can only send data for a limited amount of time per hour
			* Channel duty cycles : 0.1%, 1% or 10%
			* The latter is often used by GWs to serve a large number of devices
	* United States :
		* US 915 (902 - 928)
		* 64 channels
		* Dedicated uplink and downlink channels
		* Dwell Time / Transmission Time / Time on Air < 400ms
	* During the join procedure, the network can instruct the devices to use additional channels
	* Fixed limits on transmission power per channel band :
		* Japan : Listen-Before-Talk
* No pairing between devices and GWs :
	* No handover from cell to cell needed
* Roaming refers to communication between NS that allows devices to operate on net they are not registered with
* Two kinds of roaming are supported :
	* Active roaming : a device's home network actively hands-over communications to the NS local to where the device has moved
	* Passive roaming : the local NS simply forwards packets to a device's home NS

===== Network Architecture and Data Flow =====

==== Physical Infrastructure ====
* Made of devices that send and receive data to and from GWs that are connected to the internet
* Devices are small pieces of hardware that can send and receive data via a LoRa Radio
	* Have a kind of sensing capability and computing power, and can last on a small battery for months to years
	* Can communicate bidirectionnaly
	* Operate in 3 types of classes depending on when they can receive downlink messages
	* We choose the device class based on power consumption and acceptable latency for downlink messages
	* Can change operational modes at any time
	* All devices are compliant with class A :
		* Can send messages at any time (uplinks)
		* Can receive messages only after sending (RX window)
		* Always initiates communication to go into deep sleep mode between transmitions
		* Most battery-efficient operational mode
	* Class B devices :
		* Can receive messages at specific time intervals
		* Consume more energy than class A (must wake-up from deep sleep on a set schedule)
		* Uses beacons to sync time intervals with network
	* Class C devices :
		* Can receive messages at any time
		* Most energy consuming class (no deep sleep)
* Gateways / Hotspots / Access Points :
	* Forward messages from device to network server & vice versa
	* Demodulate received signals to a binary buffer, then send it through it backhaul (normal internet connection i.e. Ethernet / wifi / cellular)
	* Includes metadata (RSSI, SNR, ToA, Channel, DR) when forwarding messages
	* Are transparent as all the network mechanisms are performed by NS, AS and JS
	* Receive data packets from all end devices in range and send them to NS, including the ones not associated with the network
	* In case of roaming, the NS will receive data from the device from another NS and then decide to transfer to home NS or drop if there is no roaming agreement
	* Handle thousands of devices
	* Listen on multiple channels simultaneously
	* Typically support 8, 16 or 64 channels
	* Align with the regional parameters of the LoRa Alliance
