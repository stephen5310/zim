====== 2. LoRa and LoRaWAN ======
Created mercredi 01 mars 2023

===== LoRa and its usefulness =====

* Allows low cost battery-powered devices to send small packets of data over a long distance
* Chirp Spread Spectrum modulation for long range and robustness
* Data rate is low and varies from 300bps to 11kbps :
	* Maximum packet size depends on Region
	* In Europe it is 222bytes at a high data rate and 51bytes at a low data rate
	* Useful to send behavior data to devices and receive data from sensors
* End devices can send data at any time because GWs are always listening :
	* Network serve can send data to end devices during Receive (RX) windows
	* End devices can be put into deep sleep mode to conserve battery power
	* Can configure end device to listen continuously
	* Can configure time slots when a given number of devices listen to data from the network
* Geolocation with triangulation :
	* Devices send the same signal to every GW in range
	* GWs sync with GPS timestamp the packet with the Time Of Arrival (TOA)
	* GWs transmit packets to NS along with metadata, TOA, RSSI, SNR
	* NS calculates location with data received when at least 3 GWs received the same packet
	* Less accurate than GPS but less power consuming and more efficient in asset tracking

===== LoRa Alliance =====

* Open, non-profit organization of members from IoT ecosystem across the entire LPWAN value chain
* Membership types are Sponsors, Contributors, Adopters and Institutional
* Founded in 2015
* Develops and maintains the LoRaWAN standard, a carrier-grade IoT LPWAN connectivity
* LoRaWAN is formally recognized as an ITU (International Telecommunication Union) International Standard for LPWANetworking

* LoRaWAN Certification program helps ensure devices adhere to standard
* Look for LoRaWAN Certified mark

===== Use and Constraints of the ISM Band =====

* Use of the band reserved internationally for industrial, scientific and medical devices
* Radio frequency spectrum usage is regulated by organisations or governments :
	* America : 915MHz
	* Europe : 433MHz and 868MHz
	* Asia : 923 MHz
	* Pacific : 433MHz and 915MHz
* Many countries have no authorities to regulate radio spectrum usage
* For a proper deployment of LoRaWAN worldwide, some regulations must be made in those countries
* Regulatory requirements define :
	* Frequencies
	* Transmit power and power configurations
	* Frequency hoping requirements
	* Duty or dwell time restrictions
	* Wether Listen Before Talk (LBT) is required
