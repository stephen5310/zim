====== 1. Intro to IoT ======
Created mercredi 01 mars 2023

===== Definition of IoT =====

* Networked objects that collect data from the world and share via internet for processing and various usages
* It combines computer, sensors and networks to monitor and control devices

===== Challenges of IoT Connectivity =====

* Short-range wirless :
	* Bluetooth : Connecting smartphone to car
	* Wi-Fi : Smart home devices (thermostat, alarm, entertainment systems)
* Long-range wireless :
	* LPWAN : asset tracking, utility usage monitoring
==== Challenges ====
* Devices need to be able to exchange data via a cloud :
	* Dead zones not covered by cellular or wifi : some buildings, remote areas, transiting
* Devices need low power consumption :
	* Cellular and wifi require a considerable amount of power
* Network installation and maintenance costs :
	* Wifi and cellular operational expenses for industries are high
* A LoRaWAN solution allows to contract with a LoRaWAN net provider or build a scalable network that includes data and security features

==== Wireless Connectivity Options ====

* Key Factors in Wireless Communication :
	* Range
	* Bandwidth / Data Rate
	* Power Consumption

* LPWAN :
	* Low power : single battery for years
	* Long-range communication : urban ( 2-5 km ) and rural ( 10+ km )
* Popular LPWAN technos :
	* Sigfox : 2009
		* Cover several countries in the world
		* Unlicensed sub-gigahertz spectrum
		* Chirp Spread Spectrum radio modulation
		* Robust to interference
	* Narrowband-IoT (NBIoT) : 3GPP standard
		* Licensed spectrum
		* Requires SIM card
		* Complex protocol
		* Operated by telecom companies
	* LoRa : 
		* First general purpose and low-cost modulation
		* Intended for global and commercial use
		* Unlicensed sub-gigahertz spectrum
		* Chirp Spread Spectrum radio modulation
		* Robust to interference

===== Data and Business Opportunities =====

* Data collected can have wide variety of use cases
* Agriculture
* Buildings
* Cities
* Metering of electricity, Gas, Water
* Environment
* Healthcare
* Homes and Buildings
* Industrial Control
* Retail
* Supply Chain and Logistics
