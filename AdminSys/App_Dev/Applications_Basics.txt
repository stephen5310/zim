====== Applications Basics ======
Créée le Tuesday 21 March 2023

Two types of apps :
* Compiled : Java, C, C++
* Interpreted : Python, NodeJS, Ruby, PHP

===== Compiled apps =====

* First developed, compiled then executed
* For java :
	* Write source code : MyClass.java
	* Compile : javac MyClass.java
	* Run : java MyClass

===== Interpreted =====

* Developed then run
* For python :
	* Write source code : main.py
	* Run : python main.py
* Implicitly compiled into a byte code at run
* Compilation to machine code depends on hardware
* Byte code is :
	* Intermediary between source code and machine code
	* Pre-compilation that will execute faster and is not dependant on hardware
	* Generally found in .pyc files
	* Run in an environment called python VM, where it is converted to machine code
	* Can be executed on any machine which have python VM

===== Packages, Modules, Libraries =====

* Ways to share code with other developers
* Used in apps as dependencies
* Managed by package managers for each programming language

===== Build =====

* Compile
* Run Tests
* Package
* Delivery
