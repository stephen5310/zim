====== Java ======
Créée le Tuesday 21 March 2023

* Free, open-source, huge community

===== Installation =====
* Download binaries archive from java website
* Extract and execute command to test : **java -version**

===== Java Development Kit =====
* Write code with a text editor
* Download the binary archive for jdk and extract
* Provides tools like :
	* For development : jdb to debug, javadoc to document source code
	* For build : javac to build and compile, jar to archive in a single file
	* For run : Java Runtime Environment (JRE) to run a compiled java app on any system, the java cli utility as loader
	* Tools are in the bin directory of the archive

===== Java Build and Packaging =====

==== With jdk tools ====
* Code is compiled with **javac** to byte code which is executed in JVM
* Compilation produces many files that are packaged with **jar** to produce jar or war files
	* Packaging creates automatically manifest file in META-INF/MANIFEST.MF that provides manifest version, creator and main class
* Can be run on any system with JRE, launched by **java** command : 
	* For MyClass.class file : **java MyClass**
	* For jar : **java -jar app.jar**
* Documentation is generated with : **javadoc -d doc MyClass.java**
* We can add to the process **tests**, **vulnerability scan**, **code signing**

==== With build tools ====
* Popular ones are Maven, Gradle and ANT
* Use configuration files to specify the steps of the build process and automate it
* Makes it easy for others to build and run the app
* Example with ant on CentOS :
	* Install : **yum install -y ant**
	* Create build.xml file : https://ant.apache.org/manual/using.html
	* cd into build.xml dir and run (make sure to have the rights) : **ant**
* Example with maven on CentOS :
	* Install : **yum install -y maven**
	* Create pom.xml file : https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-pom.html
	* cd into pom.xml dir and run (make sure to have the rights) : **mvn package**
	* Follow https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/maven-in-five-minutes.html for more details
	* Run jar with (groupID can be found in pom.xml) : **java -cp app.jar <groupID>.App**
