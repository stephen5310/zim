====== ArgoCD Kodekloud ======
Created mardi 23 juillet 2024

===== GitOps =====

* Extension of IaC that uses Git as the VCS
* Ensures that the desired state in the repository and the actual state in prod always match
* A GitOps operator in prod continuously monitors and pulls manifests from the git repository and applies them

==== The 4 Principles ====
* Entire system (Infrastructure and Apps manifests) must be declared in an declarative state
* All the declarative files that make the declarative state must be managed with git to make the Source of Truth State
* Any changes to the state must be applied automatically : GitOps operators or Apps agents pull the state to apply it to one or more envs
* The GitOps Operators make sure the entire system is self healing to reduce the risk of human error
	* The reconcile loop : Observe > Diff > Act

===== DevOps vs GitOps =====

===== Pull-based VS Pushed-based deployments =====

===== Feature Set and Use Cases =====

* Single Source of Truth
* Everything as a Code
* Rollback Application with Git Repo
* Everything is Auditable
* CI/CD Automation
* Continuous Deployment of Apps
* Continuous Deployment of Cluster Resources
* Continuous Deployment of Infrastructure
* Detect/Avoid configuration drift with prod state
* Multi-Cluster Deployment with only one operator installed on only one cluster

===== Benefits and Challenges =====

==== Benefits ====
* Lightweight and Vendor neutral
* Faster, Safer, Immutable, with Reproducible Deployments
* Eliminates configuration Drift
* Uses familiar tools and processes
* Revisions with history

==== Challenges ====
* Doesn't help with Secret Management
* Number of Git Repositories
* Challenges with programmatic updates
* Governance other than PR approval
* Malformed YAML/Config Manifests

===== GitOps Projects and Tools =====

* ArgoCD as GitOps controller or :
	* Atlantis : Terraform GitOps
	* Autoapply : k8s manifests GitOps
	* FluxCD : k8s GitOps
	* Helm Operator : Helm Charts GitOps
	* Flagger : k8s GitOps with testing, Canary and blue/green deployments
	* Ignite : GitOps for VMs
	* Faros : CRD based GitOps
