====== 4. IAM & AWS CLI ======
Créée le Monday 03 July 2023

===== Users & Groups =====

* A root account is create upon aws account creation
* It should not be shared
* Use it only to create IAM users
* Users are people within the organization and can be grouped
* Groups can only contain users, not other groups
* Users can be part of multiple groups, cumulating permissions
* Permissions are assigned to users and groups through IAM policies
* We apply the least privilege principle to give a user no more permissions than needed
* Create an account alias to ease signin for IAM users

===== IAM Policies =====

* Users inherit policies from groups they are part of
* Consists : 
	* A version number
	* An Id (optional)
	* Statement(s) :
		* Sid (optional) : identifier for the statement
		* Effect : Allow or Deny
		* Principal : account/user/role to apply policy
		* Action : list of actions to apply effect
		* Resource : list of resources to apply effect
		* Condition (optional) : conditions for when to apply
* Can use already defined policies or create a new policy with Visual/json policy editor
* Increase account security by : 
	* Defining a Password Policy in Account settings
	* Enabling MFA
* The password policy of the root account is applied to all IAM users
* Apply specific password policies to users with AWS Directory Service

===== Access AWS =====

* Three options : 
	* Management console : protected by password + MFA
	* CLI : protected by access keys and STS for sso
	* SDK : protected by access keys and STS for sso
==== Access keys ====
* Generate at Security Credentials > Access keys
* Managed by users themselves
* Secret credentials, not to share

==== Command Line Interface ====
* Intall following : https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html
* Gives **aws** command to access the public APIs of AWS services
* Configure access following : https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-quickstart.html
* Use IAM Identity Center is recommended
* Can use Cloudshell in the management console to avoid all the authentication hassle
* It is available only in some regions

==== Software Development Kit ====
* Libraries, language specific APIs
* Embedded within apps
* Supported JS, Python, php, .NET, ruby, java, go, node.js, C++, Android, iOS, IoT Devices
* AWS CLI is built on AWS SDK for python

===== IAM Roles for services =====

* Used to provide permissions to services to perform actions on resources
* Commonly used for EC2 instances, lambda functions and CloudFormation
* Assign an IAM role to another account so that its affected entities can perform actions in your account

===== IAM Security Tools =====

* Credentials Report (account-level) to list all users and the status of their various credentials
* Access Advisor (user-level) to show the permissions of a user and when the services were last accessed

===== Guidelines and best practices =====

* Use root account only for AWS accounts setup
* One physical user = One AWS user
* Assign users to groups and assign permissions to groups
* Create a strong password policy
* Use and enforce the use of MFA
* Create and use Roles for giving permissions to AWS services
* Use IAM Identity Center for Programmatic Access
* Audit permissions of your account using IAM Credentials Report & IAM Access Advisor
* Never share IAM users & Access Keys
