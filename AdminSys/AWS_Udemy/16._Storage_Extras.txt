* Long-term deployment options : 1 and 3 years discounted pricing

==== OpsHub ====
* Historically a cli was used to managed devices
* Install OpsHub software on computer / laptop to manage devices
	* Unlock and configure single or clustered devices
	* Transfer files
	* Launch and manage instances running on devices
	* Monitor device metrics (storage, active instances)
	* Launch compatible services on devices (EC2 instances, DataSync, NFS)

==== Snowball into Glacier ====
* Cannot import to Glacier directly
* Must import first to s3, then configure a lifecycle policy to trantion to Glacier

===== FSx =====

* Launch 3rd party high-perf FS on AWS
* Fully managed service
==== FSx for Windows File Server ====
* Fully managed Windows FS share drive
* Supports SMB & NTFS
* AD integration, ACLs, user quotas
* Can be mounted on Linux EC2 instances
* Supports Microsoft Distributed FS (DFS) Namespaces (group files across multiple FS)
* Scale up to 10s of GB/s, millions of IOPS, 100s PB of data
* Storage Options are SSD and HDD
* Can be accessed from on-premises infra (VPN or DC)
* Can be configured to be Multi-AZ (high availability)
* Data is backed-up daily to S3

==== FSx for Lustre ====
* Parallel DFS for large-scale computing
* Used for ML and HPC
* Video Processing, Financial Modeling, Electronic Design Automation
* Scales up to 100s GB/s, millions of IOPS, sub-ms latencies
* Storage Options are HDD and SSD
* Seamless integration with S3 (read S3 as a FS and write output of computations back to S3)
* Can be used from on-premises servers (VPN or DC)

==== FSx FS Deployment Options ====
* Scratch FS : 
	* Temporary storage
	* Data is not replicated, nor persisted
	* High burs (6x faster, 200MBps per TiB)
	* Usage : short-term processing, optimize costs
	* Optional S3 bucket as data repository
* Persistent FS :
	* Long-term sotrage
	* Data is replicated within same AZ
	* Replace failed files within minutes
	* Usage : long-term processing, sensitive data

==== FSx for NetApp ONTAP ====
* Managed NetApp ONTAP on AWS
* FS compatible with NFS, SMB, iSCSI protocol
* Move workloads running on ONTAP or NAS to AWS
* Works with :
	* Linux, windows, macOS
	* VMware Cloud on AWS
	* Amazon Workspaces & AppStream 2.0
	* Amazon EC2, ECS and EKS
* Storage shrinks or grows automatically
* Snapshots, replication, low-cost, compression and data de-duplication
* PIT instantaneous cloning (helpful for testing new workloads)

==== FSx for OpenZFS ====

* SMB protocol has integration with AD for user auth

==== FSx File Gateway ====
* Native access to Amazon FSx for Windows FS

===== AWS DataSync =====

* Move large amount of data to and from :
	* On-premises / other cloud to AWS (NFS, SMB, HDFS, S3 API) - needs agent
	* AWS to AWS (different storage services) - no agent needed
* Can sync to S3 (even Glacier), EFS, FSx
* Replication tasks can be scheduled hourly, daily, weekly
* File permissions and metadata are preserved (NFS POSIX, SMB)
