====== 7. EC2 Instance Storage ======
Créée le Monday 03 July 2023

===== Elastic Block Store (EBS) =====

==== Volumes ====
* EBS volumes are network drives that can be attached to instances while they run
* Used to persist data after instance termination
* Some can be mounted to multiple instances at a time, or many can be mounted to one instance
* AZ bound, snapshot to move
* Have provisioned capacity, billed for that
* Capacity can be increased over time
* Can be attached on demand
* The delete on termination option is enabled by default for the root volume only
* **It takes some time after creation to become available to attach on instance**

==== Snapshots ====
* A snapshot is a backup at a Point In Time (PIT)
* Not necessary, but recommended to detach the volume before doing a snapshot
* Can be copied across AZ or region
* Can be used to create a volume
* Can be moved to an archive tier that is 75% cheaper but takes up to 72H to restore
* Use the recycle bin to retain and recover deleted snapshot during a period by setting rules 
* Can use Fast Snapshot Restore to force full initialization of a snapshot to have no latency on the first use (expensive)

==== Volume types ====
https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/volume-types/
* ssd-based : can be used as root volumes
	* io1 / io2 / io2 block express : high performance EBS storage option designed for critical, I/O intensive database and application workloads, as well as throughput-intensive database and data warehouse workloads, supports EC2 Nitro for more IOPS, support EBS multi-attach (AZ-bound, 16 max), can provision IOPS sometimes independantly of storage size
	* gp1 / gp2 : ideal for a wide variety of applications that require high performance at low cost
* hdd-based : cannot be used as root volumes
	* st1 : ideal for frequently accessed, throughput-intensive workloads with large datasets and large I/O sizes
	* sc1 : ideal for less frequently accessed workloads with large, cold datasets

===== Amazon Machine Image (AMI) =====

* Customization of EC2 instance
* Region-bound, can be copied across regions
* Used to launch instances
* Provided by AWS, Marketplace, yourself
* Steps to build AMI :
	* Start instance
	* Customize
	* Stop instance
	* Build AMI (also creates snapshots)

===== Instance Store =====

* Storage of the physical machine on which the EC2 instance is created
* Used for better I/O and throughput
* Storage is lost upon stop or termination (ephemeral)
* Good for buffer, cache, scratch data, temporary content
* Risk of data loss if hardware fails (no backup nor replication)

===== Encryption =====

* For an encrypted EBS volume :
	* Data at rest is encrypted inside
	* All data in flight moving between the instance and the volume is encrypted
	* All snapshots are encrypted
	* All volumes restored from snapshots are encrypted
* Encryption and decryption are handled transparently
* Minimal impact on latency
* Leverages keys from KMS (AES-256)
* Copying an unecrypted snapshot allows encryption

===== Elastic FileSystem (EFS) =====

* Managed NFS (NFSv4.1) that can be mounted on many EC2, POSIX fs
* Multi-AZ, HA, scalable, expensive, pay per use (no provisioning)
* Used for content management, web serving, data sharing, Wordpress
* Use SG to control access
* Only compatible with linux AMIs
* Encryption at rest using KMS
* Performance mode (set at creation time) :
	* General purpose (default) : latency sensitive use-cases (web server, CMS, ...)
	* Max I/O : higher latency, throughput, highly parallel (big data, media processing)
* Throughput mode :
	* Enhanced : More flexibility and higher throughput levels
	* Bursting : 1TB=50MiB/s + burst up to 100MiB/s
	* Provisioned : Set regardless of storage size
	* Elastic : Scale automatically based on workload
* Storage tiers :
	* Standard : frequently accessed files
	* Infrequent access (EFS-IA) : cost to retrieve files, lower cost to store, enable with lifecycle policy
* Availability and durability :
	* Standard : Multi-AZ , good for prod
	* One Zone : great for dev, backup enabled by default, compatible with IA (EFS One Zone IA)
