====== 28. Disaster Recovery ======
Created jeudi 24 ao√ªt 2023

===== Overview =====

* Any event that has a negative impact on a company's business continuity or finances is a disaster
* DR is about preparing for and recovering from a disaster
* Kinds of DR :
	* On-premise - On-premise : traditional DR, very expensive
	* On-premise - Cloud : hybrid recovery
	* Cloud Region A - Cloud Region B
==== Recovery Point Objective (RPO) ====
* How often backups are run
* Time between disaster and RPO is data loss
* How much of data loss are you willing to accept when a disaster occurs

==== Recovery Time Objective (RTO) ====
* Time to recover after a disaster
* Time between disaster and RTO is app downtime

==== Tips ====
* Backup :
	* EBS snapshots, RDS automated backups / snapshots
	* Regular pushes to S3 / S3 IA / Glacier, Lifecycle policy, Cross-region Replication
	* From On-Premise : Snowball or Storage GW
* HA :
	* R53 to migrage DNS over from Region to Region
	* RDS Multi-AZ, ElastiCache Multi-AZ, EFS, S3
	* Site to Site VPN as a recovery from DC
* Replication :
	* RDS Cross Region, Aurora + Global DB
	* DB replication from on-premise to RDS
	* Storage GW
* Automation :
	* CloudFormation / Beanstalk to re-create whole new env
	* Recover / Reboot EC2 instances with CW if alarms fail
	* Lambda functions for customized automations
* Chaos :
	* Use chaos monkeys to test infrastructure resiliency

===== DR Strategies =====

==== Backup and Restore ====
* Cheap, easy to manage
* High RPO and RTO

==== Pilot light ====
* Small version of app always running in the cloud
* Useful for the critical core (DB only for example)
* Lower RPO and RTO than Backup and Restore

==== Warm Standby ====
* Full system up and running, but at minimum size - can be expensive
* Upon disaster can scale to production load

==== Multi-Site / Hot Site ====
* Very low RTO and RPO - very expensive
* Full production scale running on AWS and On Premise

==== All AWS Multi Region ====
* Same as Multi-Site

===== Database Migration Service (DMS) =====

* Quickly and securely migrate db to AWS, resilient, self healing
* The source db remains available during the migration
* Supports :
	* Homogeneous migrations : ex Oracle to Oracle
	* Heterogeneous migrations : ex MS SQL Server to Aurora
* Continuous Data Replication using Change Data Capture (CDC)
* Must create an EC2 instance to perform the replication tasks
* When multi-AZ enabled, DMS provisions and maintains a synchronously stand-by replica in a different AZ :
	* Provides data redundancy
	* Eliminates I/O freezes
	* Minimizes latency spikes

==== Schema Conversion Tool (SCT) ====
* Convert your db schema from one engine to another
* SQL Server or Oracle to MySQL, PostgreSQL, Aurora
* Teradata or Oracle to Amazon Redshift
* No need for same engine migration

===== On-Premise strategy with AWS =====

==== VM Import / Export ====
* Migrate existing apps into Ec2
* Create a DR repository strategy for on-premise VMs
* Can export back from EC2 to on-premise

==== Application Discovery Service ====
* Gather infos about on-premise servers to plan migration
* Server utilization and dependency mappings
* Track with Migration Hub

==== Server Migration Service ====
* Incremental replication of on-premise live servers to AWS

===== AWS Backup =====

* Fully managed service to centrally manage and automate backups across AWS services
* No need to create custom scripts and manual processes
* Supported services are EC2, EBS, S3, RDS, Aurora, DynamoDB, DocumentDB, Neptune, EFS, FSx, Storage GW (volume GW)
* Supports cross-region and cross-account backups
* Suports PITR for supported services
* On-demand and scheduled backups
* Tag-based backup policies
* Create backup policies known as Backup Plans
	* Backup frequency (every 12h, daily, weekly, monthly, cron expression)
	* Backup window
	* Transition to cold storage (never, days, weeks, months, years)
	* Retention Period (always, days, weeks, months, years)
* Use Backup Vault Lock to enforce a WORM state for all backups in Vault :
	* Additional layer of defense to protect backups
	* Even root user cannot delete backups when enabled

===== Application Discovery Service =====

* Plan migration projects by gathering infos about on-premises data centers
* Server utilization data and dependency mapping are important for migrations
* Agentless Discovery (AWS Agentless Discovery Connector)
	* VM inventory, configuration, and performance history such as CPU, memory, and disk usage
* Agent-based Discovery (AWS Application Discovery Agent)
	* System configuration, system performance, running processes, and details of network connections between systems
* Resulting data can be viewed within AWS Migration Hub

===== Application Migration Service (MGN) =====

* Replacing Server Migration Service (SMS)
* Lift-and-shift (rehost) soluction to simplify apps migration to AWS
* Converts physical, virtual, and cloud-based servers to run natively on AWS
* Supports wide range of platforms, OS and db
* Minimal downtime, reduced costs

===== VMware Cloud on AWS =====

* Extend the on-premise VMware Data Center capacity to AWS
* Migrate VMware vSphere-based workloads to AWS
* Run production workloads across vSphere-based private, public and hybrid cloud envs
* Have a disaster recovery strategy
