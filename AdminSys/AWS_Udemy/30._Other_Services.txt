	* You can estimate the costs or your resources using the CF template
	* Can automate deletion and recreation of templates for savings
* Productivity :
	* Destroy and re-create infras on the fly
	* Automated generation of Diagram for templates with CF Stack Designer :
		* All the resources and relations between them are represented
	* Declarative programming (no ordering or orchestration needed)
	* Leverage existing templates on the web and documentation
