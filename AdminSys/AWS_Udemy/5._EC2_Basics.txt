====== 5. EC2 Basics ======
Créée le Monday 03 July 2023

===== Billing Service =====

* Allow IAM users with Billing view permission to access Billing by using root account and modifying Account settings
* Go to Bills to see what service is billing you
* Go to Budget to define budgets

===== EC2 overview =====

* Elastic Compute Cloud = Infrastructure as a Service
* Allows to : 
	* Rent VM (EC2)
	* Store data on virtual drives (EBS)
	* Distributing load accross machines (ELB)
	* Scaling services using an auto-scaling group (ASG)
* Sizing and configuration options :
	* Operating System : linux, windows, Mac OS
	* CPU power and cores
	* RAM
	* Storage space :
		* Network-attached (EBS, EFS)
		* hardware (Instance store)
	* Network card : Speed, Public IP
	* Firewall rules : Security groups
	* Bootstrap script : User Data (runs as root)
	* For instance types : https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/

===== Types overview =====

* Naming convention : m5.2xlarge
	* m : instance class
	* 5 : generation (improves over time)
	* 2xlarge : size within class
* Instances are optimized for different use cases
* General purpose : balance between compute, memory and networking
* Compute optimized : compute intensive tasks that require high performance processors
* Memory optimized : fast performance on large data sets in memory processing
* Storage optimized : access a lot of data sets on local storage
