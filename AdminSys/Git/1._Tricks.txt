* Git is a key/value store
* Files are added with SHA1 as key and filename as value
* Two types of command
* Porcelain commands are easy to remember : **add, status, commit, stash, ...**
* Plumbing commands give access to the internals : **hash-object, ls-files, rev-parse, ls-remote ...**

===== Git file adding mechanism =====

==== Hash a file ====
* Hashes file like this command does : **git hash-object <file_path>**
* Creates subdir of [[~./git/object]] with the first two letters of hash as the name
* Created dir contains the hash of the file
* Cat file content with : **git cat-file -p <hash_1st_six_letters>**
* Cat commit content with : **git cat-file -p <commit_hash>**
==== Objects in object folder ====
* Object types are : **commit, tree, blob**
* Tree : folder on FS associated with repository
* Pieces of data
