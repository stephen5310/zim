10.152.12.10 .9 LRC
10.152.12.25 SUPPORT
10.152.12.33 SLRC

connect to IT vpn

ssh 10.152.12.10 (AWS LRC)

telnet 0 2009 (123) : 
	open reverse ssh to gateways : lrr shell <lrrid> openssh -P portnumber(5charStartBy2) ?
	close reverse ssh to gateways : lrr shell 1000034b closessh ?

Connect to the gateway :
	generate a password for the gateway on Actility keypass (needs lrrid and customer flag)
	connect to support serverds

Gateway rescue port : 
	opened when the gw can't establish a connection with the ns (certs expiration, etc)
	calculated with the lrrid
	* ssh root@localhost -p

later 10.152.

LoRA trafi : TRACE.log

checkvpn2 : ensure the gw will connect to servers with an encrypted connection
ipsec status
find / -name checkvpn2.sh
[[/home/actility/lrr/ipsecmgr/checkvpn2sh]] -v
netstat | grep 2404

having the wrong routes in ipfailover2 will result in connection errors in the GUI

after changing iptables rules :
	/etc/init.d/firewall restart

see all the uplinks and downlinks of a BS :
	track <LRR_ID> 

Meeeeeeeeeeee

connect to the lrc , telnet , list gateways , open reverse ssh to a gateway with a Port
connect to support , connect to ssh mlbadmin@localhost -p Port (pwd root)
BS logs are deleted after restart
Learn ftp, sftp, dns, http, ipsec, iptables,
NTP is very important because a problem of synchronisation could lead to a loss of information (downlink sent when the reception window of the device is closed)
For network problems, first LRC logs, next LRR logs
For gateway connection problems, stop LRR and check vpn before restarting it
For troubleshooting purposes, master log checking and APIs
