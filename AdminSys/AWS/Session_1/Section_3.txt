* Clusters of data centers
* All around the world
* Most services are region scoped (if you change region, you have to subscribe to the service again)
* To choose the region look at :
	* Compliance with data governance and legal requirements (data never lives a region without explicit permission)
	* Proximity to customers
	* Available services
	* Pricing, which varies region to region
* A region has many **Availability Zones** (min 2, max 6) :
	* One or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, connectivity
	* Isolated from disasters
	* Connected with high bandwidth, ultra-low latency networking
	* Linked together, they form the **Region**
* **Points of Presence** (PoP) are locations where content is delivered to end users with lower latency
* Some services are global :
	* IAM
	* Route 53 (DNS)
	* CloudFront (CDN)
	* WAF (Firewall)
