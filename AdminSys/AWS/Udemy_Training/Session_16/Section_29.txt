Created lundi 19 septembre 2022

===== HPC on AWS =====

==== Data Management & Transfer ====

* Direct connect
* Snowball & Snowmobile
* AWS DataSync

==== Compute & Networking ====

* EC2 Instances :
	* CPU optimized, GPU optimized
	* Spot Instances / Spot Fleets for cost savings + Auto Scaling
* EC2 Placement Groups : Cluster for good network performance
* EC2 Enhanced Networking (SR-IOV)
	* Higher bandwidth, higher packets/s, lower latency
	* Option 1 : Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) up to 100Gbps
	* Option 2 : Intel 82599 VF up to 10Gbps - legacy
* Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA)
	* Improved ENA for HPC, only for linux
	* Great for inter-node communications, tightly coupled workloads
	* Leverages Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard
	* Bypasses the underlying Linux OS to provide low-latency, reliable transport

==== Storage ====

* Instance-attached storage :
	* EBS : up to 256,000 IOPS with io2 Block Express
	* Instance Store : up to millions of IOPS, linked to EC2 instance, low latency
* Network storage :
	* S3 : large blob, not file system
	* EFS : scale IPS based on total size, or use provisioned IOPS
	* FSx for Lustre :
		* HPC optimized distributed file system, millions of IOPS
		* Backed by S3

==== Automation and Orchestration ====

* AWS Batch :
	* Supports multi-node parallel jobs, run single jobs that span multiple EC2 instances
	* Easily schedule jobs and launch EC2 instances accordingly
* AWS ParallelCluster :
	* Open-source cluster management tool to deploy HPC on AWS
	* configure with text files
	* Automate creation of VPC, Subnet, cluster type and instance types
	* Ability to enable EFA on the cluster
