===== MyTodoList =====

==== Give users access to their own directory in S3 bucket ====

* Auth with Cognito which will generate temp credentials with STS
* Client uses temp credentials to store/retrieve files in bucket

===== MyBlog.com =====

==== Welcome email flow ====

* DynamoDB Stream changes invoke lambda
* Lambda sends email with Amazon Simple Email Service (SES)

===== Software updates offloading =====

* ELB + ASG multi AZ EC2 instances backed with EFS
* Solution for offloading : CloudFront
	* No changes to architecture
	* Will cache software update files at the edge
	* Unlike EC2, CloudFront is serverless and will distribute and scale updates without additional cost
	* ASG will not scale as much, saving tremendously in EC2
