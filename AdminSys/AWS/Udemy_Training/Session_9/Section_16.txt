Created lundi 05 septembre 2022

====== Storage Extras ======

===== Snow Family =====

* Highly-secure, portable devices to collect and process data at the edge
* Offline devices used to migrate data in and out of AWS
* Use snowball devices if migration takes more than a week
* Cannot transfer from Snowball to Glacier directly (Must put on S3 bucket before)

==== Data migration ====

* Request device from AWS console for delivery
* Install snowball client / AWS OpsHub on servers
* Connect snowball to servers and copy files using the client
* Ship back device when done
* Data will be loaded into an S3 bucket
* Snowball is competely wiped

=== Snowball Edge ===

* Offline
* Move TBs or PBs of data
* Pay per data transfer job
* Provide block storage and Amazon S3-compatible object storage
* Snowball Edge Storage Optimized :
	* 80 TB of HDD capacity for block volume and S3 compatible object storage
* Snowball Edge Compute Optimized :
	* 42 TB of HDD capacity for block volume and S3 compatible object storage
* Use cases : large data cloud migrations, Datacenter decommission, disaster recovery

=== Snowcone ===

* Small, light portable computing, rugged & secure
* Used for edge computing, storage and data transfer
* 8 TBs of usable storage
* Use where Snowball does not fit (for space)
* Can be sent back to AWS offline, or connect it to internet and use AWS DataSync to send data

=== Snowmobile ===

* Truck
* Each has 100PB of capacity
* Use multiple in parallel to transfer exabytes of data
* High security : temparature controlled, GPS, 24/7 video surveillance
* Better for more than 10PB
* Offline

==== Edge computing ====

* Process data while being created on an edge location
* Locations with limited / no internet access
* Locations with limited / no easy access to computing power
* Setup Snowball Edge / Snowcone to do edge computing
* Use cases : 	
	* Preprocess data
	* Machine learning at the edge
	* Transcoding media streams
* Eventually ship back to AWS for transferring data

=== Snowcone ===
	* 2CPUs, 4 GB RAM, wired or wireless access
	* USB-C power using a cord or the optional battery

=== Snowball Edge - Compute Optimized ===
	* 52 vCPUs, 208 GiB of RAM
	* Optional GPU (useful for video processing or machine learning)
	* 42TB usable storage

=== Snowball Edge - Storage Optimized ===
	* Up to 40 vCPUs, 80 GiB of RAM
	* Object storage clustering available
* All can run EC2 instances & AWS Lambda functions (using AWS IoT Greengrass)
* Long-term deployment options : 1 and 3y discounted pricing

==== OpsHub ====

* Software to install on computer to manage Snow Family Devices

===== FSx =====

* Launch 3rd party high-perf fs (Lustre, Windows File Server, NetApp ONTAP) on AWS
* Fully managed service
* Scratch FS :
	* Temporary storage
	* Data is not replicated
	* High burst (6x faster, 200MBps per TiB)
	* Used for short-term processing, optimize costs
* Persistent FS :
	* Long-term storage
	* Data is replicated within the same AZ
	* Replace failed files within minutes
	* Used for long-term processing, sensitive data

==== FSx for Windows ====

* Fully managed windows FS shared drive
* Supports SMB and NTFS
* Microsoft AD integration, ACLs, user quotas
* Can be mounted on Linux EC2 instances
* Scale up to 10s of GB/s, millions of IOPS, 100s PB of data
* Storage Options are SSD and HDD
* Can be accessed from on-premise infra (VPN or Direct Connect)
* Supports Multi-AZ
* Data is backed-up daily to S3

==== FSx for Lustre ====

* Parallel distributed FS, for large-scale computing (Machine learning, HPC)
* Linux cluster for Lustre
* Video Processing, Financial Modeling, Electronic Design Automation
* Scales up to 100s GB/s, millions of IOPS, sub-ms latencies
* Storage Options are SSD and HDD
* Seamless integration with S3
	* Can read S3 as a FS
	* Can write the output back to S3
* Can be used from on-premises servers (VPN or Direct Connect)

===== Storage Gateway =====

* Bridge between on-premises and cloud data in S3
* Use cases : disaster recovery, backup & restore, tiered storage

==== File GW ====

* Makes S3 buckets accessible using NFS and SMB
* Supports S3 standard, S3 IA, S3 One Zone IA
* Bucket access using IAM roles for each File GW
* Most recently used data is cached in the File GW
* Can be mounted on many servers
* Integrated with AD for user auth

==== Volume GW ====

* Block storage using iSCSI protocol backed by S3
* Backed by EBS snapshots which can help restore on-premises volumes
* Cached volumes : low latency access to most recent data
* Stored volumes: entire dataset is on premise, scheduled backups to S3

==== Tape GW ====

* For companies with backup processes using physical tapes
* Tape GW uses the process in the cloud
* Virtual Tape Library backed by Amazon S3 and Glacier
* Backup data using existing tape-based processes and iSCSI interface
* Works with leading backup software vendors

==== Hardware appliance ====

* Using Storage GW need on-premises virtualization
* Otherwise we can buy Storage GW Hardware Appliance from amazon
* Works with all types of GW
* Has all resources to work correctly
* Helpful for daily NFS backups in small data centers

==== FSx File GW ====

* Native access to FSx for Windows File Server
* Local cache for frequently accessed data
* Windows native compatibility
* Useful for group file shares and home directories

===== Transfer Family =====

* Fully managed service for file transfers into and out of S3 or EFS using FTP
* Supports FTP, FTPS, SFTP
* Managed infra, scalable, reliable, HA
* Pay per provisioned endpoint per hour + data transfers in GB
* Store and manage users credentials within the service
* Integrate with existing auth systems (AD, LDAP, Okta, Am Cognito, custom)
* Used for sharing files, public datasets, CRM, ERP, ...
