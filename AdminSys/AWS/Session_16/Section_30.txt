	* Can estimate costs of resources using CloudFormation template
	* Savings strategy : In Dev, automate deletion and recreation of templates
* Productivity :
	* Ability to destroy and recreate infra on the fly
	* Automated generation of Diagram for templates
	* Declarative programming (no need to figure our ordering and orchestration)
* Leverage existing templates on the web and doc
* Use Stack Designer to see designed stacks :
	* Can see all resources and relations between components

* Easy to use, Highly scalable, cost-effective, fully managed & secure, pay per usage

===== Batch =====

* Fully managed batch processing at any scale
* Efficiently run 100,000s of computing batch jobs on AWS
* Batch job is a job with a start and end (opposed to continuous)
* Dinamically launch EC2 instances or Spot instances
* Provisions the right amount of compute / memory
* Batch jobs are defined as Docker images and run on ECS
* Helpful for cost optimizations and focusing less on infra
* No time limit
* Any runtime as long as it's packaged as a Docker image
* Rely on EBS / instance store for disk space

===== AppFlow =====

* Fully managed integration service that enables you to securely transfer data between SaaS apps and AWS
