===== Presentation =====

* Declarative GitOps CD tool for k8s resources defined in a Git repo
* Continously monitors running apps and compare their live state to the desired state
* Reports the deviations and provide visualizations to help developers manually or automatically sync the live state with the desired state

==== Benefits of using ArgoCD ====
* Extends the benefits of declarative specifications and Git-based conf management
* First step in achieving continuous operations based on monitoring, analytics, and automated remediation
* Can deploy to multiple clusters and is enterprise-friendly (auditability, compliance, security, RBAC, SSO, and lot more)

==== How it works ====
* Follows gitops pattern by using Git repos as source of truth for the desired state of app and the target deployment envs
* Support k8s manifests as Kustomize apps, Helm Charts, Ksonnet apps, Jsonnet files, yaml/json manifests
* Automates the sync of the desired app state with each of the specified target envs
