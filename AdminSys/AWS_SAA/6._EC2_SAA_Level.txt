====== 6. EC2 SAA Level ======
Créée le Monday 03 July 2023

===== Private vs Public vs Elastic IP =====

* EC2 instances change public iP when stopped
* Use Elactic IP for a fixed public IP :
	* Can be attached to one instance at a time
	* Can be moved to another started instance
	* Max 5 per account, can ask for an increase
	* Try to avoid because it reflects poor architectural decisions
	* Use random public IP and register a DNS name to it
* We are billed if the Elastic IP is not associated with an instance

===== Placement Groups =====

* Used to control the instances placement strategy :
	* Cluster : low-lantency group in a single AZ, same rack
	* Spread : spreads across underlying hardware (max 7 instances per group per AZ) for critical apps
	* Partition : spreads instances across many different partitions (on different sets or racks) within AZ, scales to 100s instances per group for big data

===== Elastic Network Interfaces (ENI) =====

* Logical component in VPC that represents a virtual network car
* Can have :
	* Primary IPv4, one or more secondary IPv4
	* One EIP per private IPv4
	* One Public IPv4
	* One or more SG
	* A MAC address
* Can be created independantly and attached on the fly for failover
* Bound to specific AZ

===== Hibernate =====

* The RAM content is preserved during 60 days max:
	* It is writtend to a file in the root EBS volume
* It allows to boot much faster
* The EBS volume must be encrypted and have as much free space as the RAM size
* Option must be enabled during instance creation
* Used for long-running processing, saving RAM state, services that take time to initialize
* Not supported for bare metal instances
