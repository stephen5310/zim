====== 15. CloudFront & Global Accelerator ======
Created vendredi 04 ao√ªt 2023

===== CloudFront =====

* CDN used to imporve read performance : content is cached at the edge
* 216 PoP globally (edge locations)
* DDoS protection, integration with Shield and WAF
* Origins can be :
	* S3 bucket :
		* For distributing files and caching them at the edge
		* Enhanced security with CloudFront Origin Access Control (OAC)
		* OAC is replacing Origin Access Identity (OAI)
		* CloudFront can be used as an ingress (to upload files to S3)
	* Custom Origin (HTTP)
		* ALB, EC2 instance : SG must allow all CloudFront Edge Locations public IPs (https://d7uri8nf7uskq.cloudfront.net/tools/list-cloudfront-ips)
		* S3 website
		* Any HTTP backend
* Cross Region Replication is great for dynamic content that needs to be available at low-latency in few regions
* CloudFront is great for static content that must be available everywhere
* There is no private VPC connectivity in CloudFront

==== Geo Restriction ====
* Allowlist to list approved countries
* Blocklist to list banned countries
* The country is determined using a 3rd party Geo-IP database

==== Pricing and price classes ====
* The cost of data out per edge location varies
* Reduce the number of edge locations to reduce costs
* Three price classes :
	* All : all regions
	* 200 : most regions excluding most expensive regions
	* 100 : only the least expensive regions

==== Cache invalidation ====
* Refreshes content only after TTL expiration
* Can force entire/partial cache refresh by performing a **CloudFront Invalidation**
* Can invalidate all files (*) or a special path (/images/*)

===== Global Accelerator =====

* Go as fast as possible through AWS network to minimize latency
* Uses Anycast IP : all servers hold the same IP and the client is routed to the nearest one
* Client talks to closest Edge location and goes through AWS internal network to route app
* Gives two static IP addresses to end users around the globe for whatever app
* Works with Elastic IP, EC2 instances, ALB, NLB, public or private
* Consistent Performance :
	* Intelligent routing to lowest latency and fast regional failover
	* No issue with client cache (because IP does not change)
	* Internal AWS network
* Health Checks :
	* Global Accelerator performs a health check or apps
	* Helps make app global (failover less than 1mn for unhealthy)
	* Great for disaster recovery
* Security :
	* Only 2 external IP to whitelist
	* DDoS protection with Shield
* Pricing :
	* Fixed fee : charged per every full or partial hour of accelerator running
	* Data Transfer-Premium fee : charged per gigabyte of data transferred over AWS network
