====== OpenTelemetry ======
Created dimanche 17 novembre 2024

===== Definition =====

* Obervability framework and toolkit designed to create and manage telemetry data such as traces, metrics and logs
* Vendor-agnostic and tool-agnostic, can be used with Jaeger, Prometheus and commercial offerings
* Not an observability backend like Jaeger, Prometheus and commercial offerings
* Focused on the generation, collection, management and export of telemetry
* Satisfies the need for observability while following two key principles :
	* You own the data that you generate. There is no vendor lock-in.
	* You only have to learn a single set of APIs and convention.

===== Main Components =====

* A specification for all components
* A standard protocol that defines the shape of telemetry data
* Semantic conventions that define a standard naming scheme for common telemetry data types
* API that define how to generate telemetry data
* Language SDK that implement the specification, APIs, and export telemetry data
* A library ecosystem that implements instrumentation for common libraries and framework
* Automatic instrumentation components that generate telemetry data without requiring code changes
* The OpenTelemetry Collector, a proxy that receives, processes and exports telemetry data
* Various other tools, such as the OpenTelemetry Operator for Kubernetes, OpenTelemetry Helm Charts, and Community Assets for FaaS
