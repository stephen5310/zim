====== 2. Pipelines ======
Créée le Monday 05 June 2023

===== Jenkinsfile =====

* Text file with definitions (Instructions, templates, plugins, services, servers)
* Tells a pipeline what to do with what service
* All required plugins must be installed before executing some commands
* The structure is :
	1. Task to accomplish
		a. Build agent
		b. Tools (have them all installed)
		c. Environment
		d. Stages of task
			1. Substages of task
				a. Steps of substage
* Example : 
pipeline {
	agent any
	tools {
		go 'go-1.17'
	}
	
	environment {
		GO111MODULE='on'
	}
	
	stages {
		stage('Dev and Test') {
			steps {
				echo 'Dev..'
				git 'https://github.com/AdminTurnedDevOps/go-webapp-sample.git'
				sh 'go test ./...'
			}
		}
		stage('Build') {
			steps {
				echo 'Building..'
				script {
					app = docker.build("**adminturneddevops/go-webapp-sample**")
				}
			}
		}
		stage('Deploy') {
			steps {
				echo 'Deploying..'
			}
		}
	}
}

* Multi-Stage pipelines are used for deploying to multiple environments in the order specified
* They allow to deploy to dev, staging and prod by preventing deployment in prod and staging if dev fails
