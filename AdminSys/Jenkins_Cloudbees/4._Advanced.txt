===== Project types =====

==== Freestyle ("chained") projects ====
* Also called jobs
* Use job orchestration tools such as Job DSL (Domain Specific Language) plugin or Jenkins Job Builder
* Not recommended for new development
* Only provide sequential steps although can be chained with upstream/downstream
* Not defined in code, only through GUI
* Do not provide centralized conf
* Result is cumbersome with modern projects, hard to maintain, difficult to visualize
* Many continuous objectives will be very difficult to implement because of :
	* Complex conditional logic
	* Resource allocation and cleanup difficulties
	* Human interaction for manual approval not supported
	* Disability to resume at some point of failure

==== Pipeline projects ====
* A pipeline is a tool for defining CD flow as code
* Two types are supported :
	* Scripted : 
		* Many freestyle jobs chained together
		* Sequential execution using Groovy expression for flow control
		* Limitations are mostly Groovy limitations
	* Declarative : 
		* Uses a framework to control execution (Groovy not necessary)
		* Can always be resumed after an interruption, no matter what caused it
		* Declarative programming model
		* Reduces the risk of syntax errors
		* Use the script step to include scripted code
* Both use a customized DSL that is based on Grrovy to programmatically manipulate Jenkins Objects
* Advantages over freestyle are :
	* Durable : Continues to run even during Controller restart
	* Pausable : can stop and wait for human input or approval
	* Versatile : supports complex real-world CD requirements (fork, join, loop, parallelize)
	* Extensible : supports custom extensions to its DSL
	* Reduces number of jobs
	* Easier maintenance
	* Decentralization of job conf
	* Easier specification through code
* Tools for working with pipelines :
	* Graphical Blue Ocean Visual Editor with the embedded Code Editor
	* Jenkins dashboard with the inline editor that is provided
	* Jenkins dashboard with a text editor and standard scm tools
* All result in **The Same Jenkinsfile**
