====== Shutdown script ======
Created lundi 26 septembre 2022

Create script in [[/etc/init.d/<script_name]]>
Can use the format below :

```
#!/bin/sh
# chkconfig: <runlevels> <start_seq_num> <kill_seq_num>
# description: An example init script to run a command at shutdown

# runmycommandatshutdown runs a command at shutdown. Very creative.

LOCKFILE=/var/lock/subsys/
start(){
	# Touch our lock file so that stopping will work correctly
	touch ${LOCKFILE}
}

stop(){
# Remove our lock file
rm ${LOCKFILE}
# Run that command that we wanted to run
mycommand
}

case "$1" in
	start) start;;
	stop) stop;;
	*)
		echo $"Usage: $0 {start|stop}"
		exit 1
esac
exit 0
```

Commands below to create simlinks in different /etc/rc directories for the different runlevels.
Simlinks start with S for startup executions and K for shutdown executions.

update-rc.d <script_name> default
chkconfig --add <script_name>
